Services: The services folder is used to store modules responsible for handling data fetching, API communication, and interacting with external services. These modules provide an abstraction layer for making HTTP requests, managing state, and handling data transformations. By isolating these service-related functionalities in a separate folder, you can keep your components focused on rendering UI and delegate data-related operations to dedicated service modules.
