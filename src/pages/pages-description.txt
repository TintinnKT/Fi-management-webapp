The src/pages folder is commonly used in web app projects as a place to organize and store individual React components or files that represent different pages or views of your application.

The purpose of the src/pages folder is to separate and group together the components that correspond to different routes or sections of your web app. Each file or component within this folder typically represents a specific page or view that the user can navigate to within the application.

By organizing your components in the src/pages folder, you can easily manage and maintain the different pages of your web app. It provides a clear structure for developers to locate and work with specific components related to each page, making it easier to understand and modify the application's behavior.

This folder structure also supports scalability, as your project grows and you add more pages or views, you can simply create new files or components within the src/pages folder without cluttering the root directory or mixing unrelated components together.
